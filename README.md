## üìå Project Overview

This project aims to **predict Parkinson‚Äôs Disease** using machine learning algorithms trained on vocal biomarker data. Parkinson‚Äôs Disease is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects motor function. By analyzing voice patterns and other clinical features, our model can predict whether a patient is likely to have Parkinson‚Äôs.

This tool can serve as an **assistive diagnostic system** for medical practitioners and researchers ‚Äî especially in areas where access to neurologists or imaging tools is limited.

## üéØ Objectives

- Predict Parkinson‚Äôs Disease with high accuracy using biomedical voice data.
- Build a lightweight, easy-to-use ML pipeline for real-world applications.
- Visualize important features contributing to prediction.
- Provide an optional user interface for live prediction.

## üîç Feature Importance

We used model explainability tools like **SHAP** and built-in `feature_importances_` to visualize which features contribute most to predictions.
